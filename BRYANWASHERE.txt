HI LINH

ALWAYS GET CHANGES BEFORE DOING ANYTHING
- fetch & merge (or pull)

WHENEVER YOU MAKE A CHANGE, 

PROPER BRIEF YET INFORMATIVE COMMENT



get new changes: (but commit changes first before retrieving files)
go to remote, select fetch from -> origin (retrieve changes)
then go to merge, local merge (should see changes)
